# MTK Recipe Plugin.

I started develping this plugin for two reasons. Have a structure for the recipes of my blog. I know there are a lot of plugins out there that would probably work much better, and probably have a lot of integrated features like SEO. But I do want to have full control of how I want to manaage the recipes of my blog. The second reason is learing how to make plugins. I found Alecad tutorias a while back and they are a good way to get things started. I have done a couple of his Youtube courses.

List of sections and features.

* Modular Administration Area
* CPT Manager
* Custom Taxonomy Manager
* Widget to upload and display media in sidebars
* Posts and Pages Gallery integration
* Testimonial Section
* Custom template sections
* Ajax based Login/Register System
* Membership protected Area
* Chat System

Modifications:
1. After Creating the full plugin change the composer to a more specific name. The inc is too generic and may cause problems.
2. To create another plugin change all the variables and recreate the composer found in part 10.
